SELECT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE PERFORMED BY A SINGLE PERSON, ASSUMING THAT A PERSON CAN ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE ACTIVITY AT A TIME.
 </a><br />
  
 ```json
EXAMPLE: CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING 6 ACTIVITIES.
START [] = {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5}; FINISH [] = {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};
NOTE: THE MAXIMUM SET OF ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE EXECUTED BY A SINGLE PERSON IS {0, 1, 3, 4}).

YOU ARE GIVEN N JOBS. JOB I IS SPECIFIED BY AN EARLIEST START TIME SI, AND A PROCESSING TIME PI. WE CONSIDER A PREEMPTIVE VERSION OF THE PROBLEM WHERE A JOB'S EXECUTION CAN BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME AND THEN COMPLETED LATER. FOR EXAMPLE IF N = 2 AND THE INPUT IS S1 = 2, P1 = 5 AND S2 = 0, P2 = 3, THEN A LEGAL PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULE IS ONE IN WHICH JOB 2 RUNS FROM TIME 0 TO 2 AND IS THEN SUSPENDED.
THEN JOB 1 RUNS FROM TIME 2 TO 7 AND SECONDLY, JOB 2 IS COMPLETED FROM TIME 7 TO 8. THE GOAL IS TO OUTPUT A SCHEDULE THAT MINIMIZES Î£CJ = 1, WHERE CJ IS THE TIME WHEN JOB J IS COMPLETED AND J RUNS FROM 1 TO N. IN THE EXAMPLE SCHEDULE GIVEN ABOVE, C1 =7 AND C2=8.</a><br />
